# 2019-Canadian-Federal-Election-Forecase
We analyzed the 2019 Canadian Election Study data, web version and used it as our survey dataset. We specifically analyzed a post-processed subset of this dataset. We also used the 2017 Canadian Social Survey (GSS) on the Family as our poststratification/census dataset. We built a multivariable linear regression model to model the political spectrum score. We found that on average, Canadians are neither too leftwing or too rightwing on the political spectrum. Therefore, we conclude that the liberals won the minority government in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election just by chance.
